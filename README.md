Computer graphics projects with openGL and C++

## Project1:

1. The window should close and the program should stop if the user presses the Q key on the keyboard. <br/>

2. The window should display the following shapes on white background:<br/>
a- A rectangle on the left which is drawn only with its borders in black.<br/>
b- A blue triangle on the right.<br/>

3. When the user clicks on the triangle, its color should change to a different color. And this should happen again and again as the user continues to click. <br/>

4. The user should be able to drag the rectangle around and place it in a new position with the mouse.<br/>

## Project2:

1. Draw a spinning cube using OpenGL. Each face of the cube should be colored with different colors. Some faces should be colored with fixed color while some of them are colored with a mixture of colors.<br/>

2. The cube should rotate after a key from keyboard is pressed. The cube should rotate to right (d key), left (a key), up (w key) and down (s key) when the corresponding key is pressed. The user can change between orthogonal and perspective projection by pressing p key.<br/>

3. The program should also handle window reshape.
